These are my attempts at solving the weekly challenges from the SlothBytes newsletter.

I probably won't be solving them every week, but I find that they are a good way to get small new programming tasks that are interesting but not too time-consuming to solve.

I will be writing most (if not all) of my programs in Python because it's the language I know best and am most comfortable with.

I'm also aware of the fact that (especially in the beginning) my programs will neither be the most efficient nor will they be the fastest possible implenmentation. I'm just trying to accomplish the goal of the exercise, efficiency comes as a bonus. Though I've found that even in that aspect the exercises are quite useful in the sense that I can practice making them more efficient without having to do so on a large, time-consuming project.

Thanks for these fun challenges every week, SlothBytes!
